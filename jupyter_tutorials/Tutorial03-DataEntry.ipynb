    "Sometimes you will collect just a few measurements and do some simple calculations with them. To measure Hooke's Law for a spring, you could just measure two compressions (distances) and two forces, and do a simple calculation. In general, however, the labs in this course will consist of making multiple measurements, with the goal to increase the quality of successive measurements. This is reflective of real scientific research, where we are constantly seeking to improve our measurement techniques to get a better understanding of the system we are studying.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have multiple measurements of the same quantity, in theory we could define a new Python variable for each measurement. However, this is clunky and quickly becomes confusing. A better way to organize data from multiple measurements is in a structure called an array. To enter our data into arrays, we'll use a library that allows us to easily enter, view and modify our array data with a **spreadsheet**-like interface. We'll use a library called 'data_entry2' to record our data, and transfer this data into Python **vectors**  (arrays) to perform subsequent calculations. A vector is simply a set of values stored under a single variable name."

Each column will be turned into a separate Python vector. The variable name of each vector is determined by taking the title of the column and appending 'Vec' to the end. For instance, if we have a column with the title 'time', then the Python vector created will be 'timeVec'. When you generate the vectors, data_entry2 will tell you the names of the variables it created, and show you all of the values in each variable. Make sure to look at the output you get after pressing the button - it will also tell you if anything went wrong. Try, for example, changing one of the zeros in a number to the letter 'o' (double-click a cell to edit it) and generating the vectors again to see what happens.
